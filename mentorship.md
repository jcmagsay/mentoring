# Have you ever participated in a formal mentorship program?
Yes

# If yes, what was your role and what are some take aways you had from this program?

## Role: TA (Teaching Assistant)

### Takeaways: It's important to designate what makes a develop vs. an engineer. A developer can do the job with help of others (Google, Stack Overflow, GitHub, Medium, etc), but you as the leader, have the strong possibility of crafting a developer's future into becoming the next generation of engineers.

## Role: Mentor Program Co-Coordinator

### Description:
I have created mentorship programs where I have helped build a curriculum to teach over a course of "x" weeks.

### Takeaways
Subject-matter is extremely important to engineers at their relevant skill-levels. Being able to explain and speak to any subject at a shallow or deep level is what truly makes a great mentor.

## Role: Mentor & Tech Manager
### Takeaways:
Checking up on people is extremely important. Asking tough questions and knowing how to get a pulse on your mentee typically leads to their greater success

## Role: Engineering Meetup Coordinator
### Takeaways:
It is important to find ways to engage fellow technical folk. Keeping people asking questions and inspired about their craft is a great way to keep growing.


# Why are you interested in being a mentor?
Mentoring is something I have always loved and enjoyed. It's so much fun to watch your peers grow, especially when you are even a small part of that growth. I've had many mentors in my career, and I'd love to continue giving back to early-career to senior engineers.

I am active in the engineering community and have mentored many of my fellow colleagues, as well as other engineers from public groups like Women in Technology. Giving back is really a huge part of what makes the tech community grow, and I absolutely love being a part of it.

I even have a mentorship section on my personal website!

# What are three key strengths and areas you bring as a mentor?

## Teaching
Being an educator is a craft. The ability to talk through problems through analogies, diagrams, industry terminology, etc. all come from years of practice in the industry.

## Respect and Compromise
"There are a thousand ways to skin a cat," is one of my favorite quotes for teaching. It is important that you do not over complicate problems with mentees. Mentees have a different way of approaching problem. Our job as mentors is not to tell them how to solve the problem differently, but to help them understand how to think about solving the problem from all points of view. Building upon a mindset is more impactful than fixing someone's code. This is also a very important lesson to teach to fellow engineers. Taking a step back and realizing that there is more than one way to solve a problem is crucial to working in a healthy and happy work environment.

## Relationship building
You cannot be a mentor without being respectable. To achieve this, you must respect those around you. It is important to remember where you started and the emotions and feelings you've experienced throughout the growth process. Reading stress-markers and body language is important to understanding and reacting to your mentee and their mental health. This is one thing that has been extremely helpful to me as a mentor

# What are you looking to gain out of this program?
I would love to continue growing and honing my skills as a mentor. There is a never-ending opportunity for self-improvement. I would also be interested in mentoring those who want to become mentors.

# Tell us about yourself, what would you like us to consider when pairing you with a mentee?
I'm easy-going and really care about the success of my mentees. I am both open to mentoring aspiring mentors, as well as mentees. Skill-levels do not matter to me, I've mentored my peers in the past with expansive and great depth of knowledge in tech. I can mentor in many different facets of technology (back-end, front-end, UX, agile, etc). I don't mind being a remote mentor either. I'm excited and look forward to the program! :)
